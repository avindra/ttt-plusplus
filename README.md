:o2: Tic Tac Toe implemented using C++ and Qt

Originally built at [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/ttt-plusplus).

## About

This project aims to be the finest implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe around in C++.

The C# version of this project is where all of this started: http://code.google.com/p/tic-tac-toe-dotnet/ ([github](https://github.com/avindra/tic-tac-toe-dotnet
))

## Stack

Developing C++ apps with GUI's is still difficult and lacking in documentation. Thankfully, there are some well-documented frameworks such as Qt which ease this process and make your projects portable.

Historically speaking, in 2010 I chose Qt over wxWidgets because wx was incredibly difficult to set up and was painful to use. Qt was similarly a challenge to set up, but once it was set up, it was easy to use.

Qt was also relicensed to LGPL, which enabled me to use the framework free of charge.

This project is built with statically linked 32-bit libraries for Qt. If you have trouble building, feel free to ask about it.

## Who this is intended for

The same people as my original project:

 * Gaming buffs
   * Strategy buffs
   * Programmers
     * Educators
     * Students

## Contribute

PRs are welcome. This is a fun little project, so requirements for joining aren't very strict at all, just demonstrate that you have an understanding of basic programming concepts.
